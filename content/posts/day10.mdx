[aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions) provides an interface to setup AWS credentials for usage in GitHub Actions.

## Example Usage

As a base, if you have an IAM user credentials, you can save them into GitHub Action's secrets in the settings tab and then add the action as follows:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-2
```

The `access-key-id`, `aws-secret-access-key`, and `aws-reigon` are the three required parameters.

Now if you use the `aws` cli or any client library of the aws-sdk tools, your setup will be properly authenticated using the provided user.
