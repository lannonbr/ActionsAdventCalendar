[WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) is a project that can track metrics of projects you work on or languages you use. With this action, [matchai/waka-box](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/waka-box) you can update a gist that is pinned to your repo page

## Example Usage

To update the gist, it needs an [API key](https://wakatime.com/settings/api-key) for WakaTime. As well given you are working outside the repo, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be used and a personal access token needs to be used instead. Then if you copy the ID of the gist (for example gist.github.com/lannonbr/920ada24... would have a gist ID of 920ada24...)

Then put all of these variables and secrets into an example workflow like such:

```yaml
name: Update gist with WakaTime stats
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/10 * * * *"
jobs:
  update-gist:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Update gist
        uses: matchai/waka-box@master
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          GIST_ID: 968220c97e8da1d047a9a480fa432e54
          WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
```

Once done, if you pin the gist, you now can have this on your main profile:
