If you wish to cache dependencies or build outputs between runs, GitHub's official [Cache Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache) solves this.

## Example Usage

This can cache absolutely anything you wish, regardless of platform or language.

For instance, if you are running Node tests in a CI/CD situation, if you cache the yarn cache, it will speed up the `yarn` up a bit. (It is reccomended that you don't cache node modules as it could cause issues as you swap between node versions & architectures).

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Get yarn cache
    id: yarn-cache
    run: echo "::set-output name=dir::$(yarn cache dir)"
  
  - name: Cache yarn cache
    uses: actions/cache@v1
    id: cache-yarn
    with:
      path: ${{ steps.yarn-cache.outputs.dir }}
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-
  
  - run: yarn
  - run: yarn test
```

It creates a hash based string using the contents of the lockfile so it will invalidate the cache if the lockfile changes. Then here, the `yarn` run will be extremely sped up as it doesn't need to hit the internet to pull any dependencies down.

## Limits

Each cache can have 400MB of cached content which is a gzipped tarball. The repo at large can have up to 2GB of caches. It will remove old caches either after the limit is hit or after a cache has been not accessed in a week.
