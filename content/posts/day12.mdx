[jakejarvis/s3-sync-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/s3-sync) is a wrapper for the AWS S3 client so you can send files into your S3 Buckets.

## Example Usage

An Example workflow could be uploading a directory into a S3 bucket for things like publishing a static website. With AWS, you'll need the default AWS credentials, the bucket, and the directory you want to sync. With an `args` parameter, you can pass in any of the flags from the `aws s3` cli command.

```yaml
name: Upload Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
      with:
        args: --acl public-read --follow-symlinks --delete
      env:
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: 'us-west-1'   # optional: defaults to us-east-1
        SOURCE_DIR: 'public'      # optional: defaults to entire repository
```
