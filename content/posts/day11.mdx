[pullreminders/slack-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/post-slack-message) will send a message to a slack channel.

## Example Usage

What is required is an access token generated from making a slack app to connect to Slack and then if you send in a stringified JSON message with a channel name and message, it will send the message out.

```yaml
- name: Notify slack
  env:
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
  uses: pullreminders/slack-action@master
  with:
    args: '{\"channel\":\"C1234567890\",\"text\":\"The tests were succesful\"}'
```

This could be used in response to things like a deploy or running tests and notifying people of a success or failure of some task.
