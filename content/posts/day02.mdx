title: 'Day 2: Optimizing Images'

When adding images into projects, they sometimes include a lot of metadata or are saved in formats that have large file sizes by default. The folks over at [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) created an action called [image-actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/image-actions) which provides a way to automatically compress JPGs, PNGs, and WebP images.

## Example Usage

As in their example, a use case is to optimize images in Pull Requests:

```yaml
name: Compress images
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: calibreapp/image-actions
        uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

so then if you had this in a project and created a PR that added some images, it would optimize them, make a new commit to the PR, and then add a comment saying which ones were compressed.
