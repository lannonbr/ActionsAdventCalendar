[upload-to-release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-to-release) by Jason Etcovich is an action which upload files into a release. 

## Example Usage

Say one manually creates a release, you can have a workflow that could build a docker image and upload the .tar output as a result. To run this, use the `release` trigger.

```yaml
name: build-docker-image

on: release

jobs:
  build-docker-image:
    name: Build and upload docker image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Pull source
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Build Docker image
        uses: actions/docker/cli@master
        with:
          args: build . -t my-image

      - name: Save the image
        uses: actions/docker/cli@master
        with:
          args: save my-image:latest

      - name: Upload to release
        uses: JasonEtco/upload-to-release@master
        with:
          args: my-image.tar
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is the only required secret and the `args` file takes a relative file and will attach it to the release.
