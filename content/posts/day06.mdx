title: 'Day 6: Label PRs upon Approval Criteria'
date: 2019-12-06

[label-approved-pull-requests](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/label-approved-pull-requests) is an action created by the Pull Panda OSS team. It will check when reviews are given on a PR and when it hits a certain amount of approvals, will change the labels on the PR to indicate it is fully approved.

## Example Usage

In the following example, when a PR gets at least 2 approvals, it will have the "approved" label added to the PR.

```yaml
on: pull_request_review
name: Label approved pull requests
jobs:
  labelWhenApproved:
    name: Label when approved
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Label when approved
      uses: pullreminders/label-when-approved-action@master
      env:
        APPROVALS: "2"
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        ADD_LABEL: "approved"
        REMOVE_LABEL: "awaiting%20review"
```

As well, it removes a "awaiting review" label by using the `REMOVE_LABEL` environment variable.
