This Action, [peter-evans/create-pull-request](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-pull-request) by [Peter Evans](https://github.com/peter-evans) will generate Pull requests after making changes in the repo in a workflow.

## Example Usage

One usecase Peter made in his [examples](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/master/examples.md) is a workflow to update NPM modules once a week and then push a PR with the changes.

```yaml
name: Update Dependencies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 10 * * 1"
jobs:
  update-deps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # checkout the repo
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      # setup node 10
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: "10.x"

      # run npm-check-updates
      - name: Update dependencies
        id: vars
        run: |
          npm install -g npm-check-updates
          ncu -u
          npm install

      # generate the PR
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          commit-message: update dependencies
          title: Automated Dependency Updates
          body: This is an auto-generated PR with dependency updates.
          branch: dep-updates
          branch-suffix: none
```

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. Otherwise all other fields are optional but can be set to add labels, body, etc to the PR rather needing to do it once the PR is made. `title`, `commit-message`, `branch`, and `body` are good to fill in.
