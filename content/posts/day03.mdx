title: 'Day 3: Audit websites automaticallly with Lighthouse'

Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) tool provides website auditing that is both built into the Chrome web browser and accessible as a Node module. With [Lighthouse-CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci), you can run Lighthouse in CI environments and send results to a dashboard.

[Treo.sh](https://treo.sh/) wrote a GitHub Action called [lighthouse-ci-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lighthouse-ci-action) that wraps Lighthouse-CI into an action.

## Example Usage

Their basic example showcases hitting a live site and doing some audits and then saving the results using GitHub's [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action to save it as an artifact of the workflow.

```yaml
name: Lighthouse
on: push
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Audit URLs using Lighthouse
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
        with:
          urls: |
            https://treo.sh/
            https://treo.sh/demo
      - name: Save results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: lighthouse-results
          path: '.lighthouseci' # This will save the Lighthouse results as .json files
```

As well, instead of saving as an artifact here, You could take those results and save them to any external service for later usage or use the [`upload`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lighthouse-ci-action#upload) parameter of this action to authenticate and send the results to a [LHCI server](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/recipes/docker-server/README.md) that can provide side-by-side changes between audits to see how things change over time.
