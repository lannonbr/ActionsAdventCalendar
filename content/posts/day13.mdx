title: 'Day 13: Check User Permissions to a Repo'

Back with another of a personal action of mine, [lannonbr/repo-permission-check-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repo-permission-check-action) will check the credential level of a user to the given repo.

## Example Usage

Say you have an Action make a comment in an issue to do some action by typing `/command` in a new comment. A maintainer may want to allow this only if a user has write access to the repo. using this action, you pass in a string of what permission level you require as a minimum.

The 4 permission levels include:

 - **none**: no access to a repo
 - **read**: pull-only access to a repo
 - **write**: pull and push access to a repo
 - **admin**: pull, push, and administrator access to a repo.


```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Check if user has write access"
    uses: "lannonbr/repo-permission-check-action@2.0.0"
    with:
      permission: "write"
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

So by passing in `write`, if you have either `write` or `admin`, the action will pass.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is required as an environment variable to authenticate with Octokit inside the action.
